<h4>Pickles and Dancing</h4>
<p class="white"> Okay so I have a pretty interesting life... haha not really. All that I really love to do is dance, eat food, and sleep. I am actually a pretty lazy person and also did I say that I love to sleep. I am pretty sure that I didn't so I just want to say that sleeping is a long time passion of mine.This is equilvalent to me sleeping.</p>

<p class="yellow">Now on to the topic of pickles. I LUV THEM!!! Do you like spears or just the regular pickles? I like spears better.Or do you like sour pickles or spicy pickles? Me... I like regular because I can't eat anything spicy. Like at all! Bad things will happen.
